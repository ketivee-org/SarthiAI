## AI Models Used in the Project

This project employs a suite of six advanced AI models, each designed for specialized tasks:

1. **Sarthi AI**: The main AI for interacting with users, handling natural language processing (NLP) to generate large contexts, write code, manage documents, solve mathematical problems, analyze medical data, and much more.
2. **AAdi AI**: Specializes in image and video generation by combining its capabilities with 3D modeling from Yug AI.
3. **Yug AI**: Creates 3D models and environments, bringing unparalleled precision to creative and industrial applications.
4. **Arth AI**: Revolutionizes sound design and music creation with advanced MIDI pattern generation and song sampling.
5. **Ved AI**: Focused on healthcare, this AI recognizes facial expressions, analyzes patient data, and aids in mental health diagnostics.
6. **Parth AI**: A locally installed AI designed to enhance security and functionality while providing real-time assistance without compromising privacy.
